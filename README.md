# Wine-Quality-prediction-model

In this prediction model I have used Machine Learning algorithms on a test dataset.
The dataset which is used,is taken from Kaggle website.
I have used rainforest algorithm and regression model.
After training and testing this model, it can predict wheather the wine's quality is good or not.
For training X and Y training set is used.

#IDE used:
Google collab (it has all the libraries and collections needed in making a predictive model)
